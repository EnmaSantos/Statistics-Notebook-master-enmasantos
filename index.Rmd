## Quick Reference Guide

### **Choosing the Right Statistical Test**

**Step 1:** Identify your response variable (Y)
- Is it **Quantitative** (numbers that can be averaged)? → Go to quantitative tests
- Is it **Categorical** (groups/categories)? → Go to categorical tests

**Step 2:** Identify your explanatory variable(s) (X)
- **None** (just one variable)? → Single variable tests
- **Categorical** X? → Comparison tests (t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-squared)
- **Quantitative** X? → Regression or correlation
- **Multiple** X variables? → Multiple regression or factorial designs

**Step 3:** Check assumptions
- **Normality**: If data is normally distributed → parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA, regression)
- **Non-normal**: If data violates normality → non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney)
- **Sample size**: Small samples (<30) → be extra careful with normality assumptions

### **Key Reminders**

<span style="color:darkred;">**Always plot your data first!**</span> Graphics reveal patterns, outliers, and violations of assumptions.

<span style="color:darkblue;">**Check assumptions before testing:**</span>
- Normality (Q-Q plots, histograms)
- Equal variance (side-by-side boxplots)
- Independence of observations

<span style="color:darkgreen;">**Interpret p-values carefully:**</span>
- p < 0.05: Evidence against null hypothesis (statistically significant)
- p ≥ 0.05: Insufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis

**Use these graphics to visualize the distribution of a single quantitative variable:**

- **[Histogram](GraphicalSummaries.html#histogram)**: Shows the shape of the distribution (normal, skewed, etc.)
- **[Boxplot](GraphicalSummaries.html#boxplots)**: Identifies outliers and shows five-number summary
- **[Dot Plot](GraphicalSummaries.html#dot-plots)**: Good for smaller datasets to see individual observations

**What to look for:** Check for normality, outliers, and whether the data is symmetric or skewed.

### Tests
<div style="padding-left:125px;color:lightgray;">
<!-- Add your customizations in the area below: -->

**Testing one quantitative variable (comparing to a hypothesized value):**

#### Parametric Tests (assume normality):
- **[One Sample t Test](tTests.html)**: Test if the mean equals a specific value
  - Use when: Data is approximately normal OR sample size is large (n > 30)
  - Example: Is the average temperature different from 72°F?

#### Non-Parametric Tests (no normality assumption):
- **[Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test](WilcoxonTests.html)**: Test if the median equals a specific value
  - Use when: Data is NOT normal AND sample size is small
  - More robust to outliers

#### Descriptive Statistics:
- **[Numerical Summaries](NumericalSummaries.html)**: Mean, median, standard deviation, five-number summary
  - Always calculate these first!
  - Compare mean vs. median to check for skewness

**Quick Tip:** If mean ≈ median, data is likely symmetric. If mean > median, data is right-skewed.

### Tests
<div style="padding-left:125px;color:lightgray;">
<!-- Add your customizations in the area below: -->

**Comparing two groups:**

#### For Independent Groups (different subjects in each group):
- **[Independent Samples t Test](tTests.html)**: Compare means of two independent groups
  - Use when: Data is normal, independent observations, roughly equal variances
  - Example: Compare heights of males vs. females
  
- **[Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon Rank Sum) Test](WilcoxonTests.html)**: Compare distributions of two independent groups
  - Use when: Data is NOT normal OR has outliers
  - Non-parametric alternative to independent t-test

#### For Paired/Dependent Groups (same subjects measured twice):
- **[Paired t Test](tTests.html)**: Compare means of paired observations
  - Use when: Before/after measurements, matched pairs
  - Example: Compare test scores before and after tutoring (same students)
  
- **[Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test](WilcoxonTests.html)**: Non-parametric version of paired t-test
  - Use when: Paired data is NOT normal

**Key Decision:** Are the groups independent or paired? This determines which test to use!

### Tests
<div style="padding-left:125px;color:lightgray;">
<!-- Add your customizations in the area below: -->

**Comparing three or more groups:**

#### Parametric Test:
- **[One-Way ANOVA](ANOVA.html)**: Compare means across 3+ groups
  - Use when: Data is normal in each group, equal variances across groups
  - Example: Compare test scores across Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior
  - Tests if **at least one** group mean is different (doesn't tell you which)
  - Follow up with post-hoc tests (Tukey, Bonferroni) to identify which groups differ

#### Non-Parametric Alternative:
- **[Kruskal-Wallis Test](Kruskal.html)**: Compare distributions across 3+ groups
  - Use when: Data violates normality OR has outliers
  - Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA
  - More robust to violations of assumptions

**Important:** ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis only tell you if groups differ overall. You need follow-up tests to determine which specific groups are different from each other.

<!-- Add your customizations in the area below: -->

**Analyzing effects of multiple categorical variables:**

#### Factorial ANOVA:
- **[Two-Way ANOVA](ANOVA.html)**: Analyze effects of 2+ categorical variables simultaneously
  - Use when: Data is normal, equal variances, independent observations
  - Tests:
    - **Main effects**: Does each factor influence Y independently?
    - **Interaction effects**: Does the effect of one factor depend on the other factor?
  - Example: Test effect of Gender AND Major on GPA

**Key Concepts:**
- **Main Effect**: The individual effect of each factor, ignoring the other factors
- **Interaction Effect**: When the effect of one factor changes depending on the level of another factor
- If interaction is significant, focus on that rather than main effects

**Example:** If studying effect of teaching method AND class time on test scores, an interaction would mean that morning classes benefit more from one teaching method while evening classes benefit more from another.

<!-- Add your customizations in the area below: -->

**Analyzing the relationship between two quantitative variables:**

#### Simple Linear Regression:
- **[Simple Linear Regression](LinearRegression.html)**: Model Y as a linear function of X
  - Use when: Relationship appears linear, residuals are normal, constant variance
  - Equation: Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε
  - Tests whether slope (β₁) is significantly different from zero
  - Provides R² (proportion of variance explained)

#### Correlation:
- **Pearson Correlation (r)**: Measures strength and direction of linear relationship
  - Range: -1 to +1
  - r = 0: No linear relationship
  - r = ±1: Perfect linear relationship
  - Use when: Both variables are approximately normal

**Important Regression Assumptions:**
1. **Linearity**: Relationship is linear (check scatterplot)
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent
3. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed (check Q-Q plot)
4. **Equal variance**: Spread of residuals is constant (check residuals vs. fitted plot)

**Remember:** Correlation does NOT imply causation!

**Analyzing Y with multiple explanatory variables:**

#### Multiple Linear Regression:
- **[Multiple Linear Regression](LinearRegression.html)**: Model Y as a function of multiple X variables
  - Use when: Want to predict Y using several explanatory variables
  - Equation: Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₖXₖ + ε
  - Can include both quantitative and categorical (dummy-coded) variables
  - Provides adjusted R² to account for number of predictors

**Key Concepts:**
- **Adjusted R²**: Better than R² for comparing models with different numbers of predictors
- **Multicollinearity**: When X variables are highly correlated (problematic!)
  - Check VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): VIF > 10 indicates problems
- **Model Selection**: Use AIC, BIC, or adjusted R² to compare models
- **Interaction terms**: Allow effect of one X to depend on another X

**Model Building Strategy:**
1. Start with all potentially relevant predictors
2. Check for multicollinearity
3. Remove non-significant predictors (or use stepwise selection)
4. Check residual plots for violations of assumptions
5. Consider transformations or interaction terms if needed

**Analyzing binary outcomes with a quantitative predictor:**

#### Simple Logistic Regression:
- **[Simple Logistic Regression](LogisticRegression.html)**: Model probability of success as a function of X
  - Use when: Y is binary (0/1, success/failure, yes/no)
  - Models: log(odds) = β₀ + β₁X
  - Produces S-shaped (sigmoid) curve for probabilities
  - Coefficients represent change in log-odds per unit change in X

**Key Concepts:**
- **Odds**: P(success) / P(failure)
- **Log-Odds (Logit)**: ln(odds) - this is what we're modeling
- **Odds Ratio**: exp(β₁) - multiplicative change in odds per unit increase in X
  - OR > 1: Positive relationship (X increases → probability increases)
  - OR < 1: Negative relationship (X increases → probability decreases)
  - OR = 1: No relationship

**Interpretation Example:** 
If β₁ = 0.5 for X = study hours predicting passing exam:
- Odds ratio = exp(0.5) = 1.65
- Each additional study hour multiplies odds of passing by 1.65

  - Common threshold: p > 0.5 → predict success

**Model Evaluation:**
- **Confusion Matrix**: Compare predicted vs. actual classifications
- **Sensitivity**: P(predict success | actual success) - true positive rate
- **Specificity**: P(predict failure | actual failure) - true negative rate
- **ROC Curve**: Plot sensitivity vs. (1-specificity) for different thresholds
- **AUC**: Area Under ROC Curve - overall model performance (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect)

**Testing association between two categorical variables:**

#### Chi-Squared Tests:
- **[Chi-Squared Test of Independence](ChiSquaredTests.html)**: Test if two categorical variables are associated
  - Use when: Both variables are categorical, independent observations
  - Tests: H₀: Variables are independent (no association)
  - Requires: Expected cell counts ≥ 5 in most cells
  - Example: Is there a relationship between gender and major choice?

- **[Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Test](ChiSquaredTests.html)**: Test if observed frequencies match expected
  - Use when: One categorical variable, testing against a theoretical distribution
  - Example: Do students choose majors equally? (test against uniform distribution)

#### Alternative for Small Samples:
- **[Fisher's Exact Test](ChiSquaredTests.html)**: Exact test for 2×2 contingency tables
  - Use when: Expected cell counts < 5 (chi-squared not appropriate)
  - Provides exact p-value without relying on chi-squared approximation
  - Computationally intensive for large samples

**Interpreting Results:**
- Significant result → Variables are associated
- Examine **residuals** to see which cells differ most from expected
- Calculate **relative risk** or **odds ratios** for 2×2 tables

**Example:** Testing if smoking status is independent of lung cancer diagnosis
