## Load Library and Explore Data

```{r}
library(mosaic)

# View help documentation
?SaratogaHouses

# View the dataset
View(SaratogaHouses)

# Table of fuel types
table(SaratogaHouses$fuel)
```

## Perform Kruskal-Wallis Test

```{r}
# Kruskal-Wallis test: Does fuel type affect home price distribution?
kruskal.test(price ~ fuel, data = SaratogaHouses)
```

## Visualize the Results

```{r}
# Boxplot to visualize price distributions by fuel type
boxplot(price ~ fuel, data = SaratogaHouses,
        main = "Home Prices by Heating Fuel Type",
        xlab = "Fuel Type",
        ylab = "Price ($)",
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen", "lightyellow"))
```

## Calculate Median Prices

```{r}
# Calculate median price for each fuel type
medians <- tapply(SaratogaHouses$price, SaratogaHouses$fuel, median)
medians

# Find which fuel type has the highest median
names(which.max(medians))

# Get the highest median value
max(medians)
```

## Summary Statistics

```{r}
# Detailed summary statistics by fuel type
favstats(price ~ fuel, data = SaratogaHouses)
```
